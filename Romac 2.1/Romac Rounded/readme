-Designed to use 1.5mm POM plate.
-Use the bottom of FR4.
-The gap between the top of the plate to the FR4 is 7.5mm.
-A layer of 1.5mm POM on the plate to raise the top layer and not damage the mpc.
-Possibility of adding layers until physical laws allow it.
-The FR4's own mounts holes could be used to add angle to the case.
-The hole left for the usb cable and in general the whole case is not verified for its functionality. I do not have the romac mounted and even less access to a laser cutter.
-Critics and advice welcome!
